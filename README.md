# AI Agent for Gene Editing

This project is being developed as part of my master thesis (15 etcs) for the Master in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics at UOC university. 

# Objectives

1 Gene editing tool calling through APIs (FORECasT, FORECasT-Repair, WGE CRISPR Search, WGE Off-Targets, and NCBI Libraries)

2 Web search calling (Tavily)

# Folder Explanation
